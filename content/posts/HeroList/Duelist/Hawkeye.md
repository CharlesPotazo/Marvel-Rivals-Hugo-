**Black Panther** Despite his lack of superpowers, Hawkeye's unparalleled skills as a marksman have earned him a spot alongside earth's mightiest heroes. With a cool head and steady hand, Clint Barton never misses a target… so enemies best stay out of his sights!

**Abilities** 

- **Piercing Arrow (LClick)** – Shoot a powerful arrow. His main and most devastating attack, you can literally one-tap people if you hit those heads. The only trick with it is that you have to track the target for a little bit so you can charge your shot. It is a projectile, making it a little bit harder to hit a shot than for example Hela, but it’s a very fast one, so don’t worry you just need a little bit of practice.

- **Blast Arrow (RClick)** – Shoot three explosive arrows. To be honest with you this ability you will not use that often, even you have it almost all the time due to that his LClick does so much more damage and it takes almost the same amount of time to do it. The only thing that can be useful is spamming at some shields and grouped up tanks.

- **Crescent Slash (LShift)** – Perform a frontal slash with a katana, launching hit enemies into the air. This is his best defensive ability, amazing to push off divers that want to be in your face like Spidey or Venom.

- **Hypersonic Arrow (E)** – Shoot a Hypersonic Arrow, dealing additional damage to enemies in its path but if they are above the center of the screen you will knock them down. This is also a great finishing move due to the fact he fires it very fast, and it’s not that hard to hit.

- **Skyward Leap (Space)** – Perform a double jump in the direction of movement. It looks like we are gonna a see some cool kill cams against Hawkeye, amazing ability for dodging bullets and avoiding dangerous spots.

- **Archer’s Focus Passive** – Aim at an enemy to improve focus, enhancing the damage inflicted by Piercing Arrow.

- **Hunter’s Sight (Q)** – Capture Afterimages of enemies in his view. Damage dealt to an Afterimage is transferred to the corresponding enemy. Your arrows will be at 100% charge all the time, so don’t stop shooting.

- **Roning Slash Melee** – Swing a wakizashi to strike frontal enemies, deflecting all incoming projectiles. This is his normal melee attack and is very hard to master due to the timing.

- **Allied Agents – Team-Up Ability** – Hawkeye can share his Hunter’s Sight with Black Widow, enabling her to catch sight of and damage afterimages of enemies. Maybe she can profit even more from this due to her being a hitscan character/
