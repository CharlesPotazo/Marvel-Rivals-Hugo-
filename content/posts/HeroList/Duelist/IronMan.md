**Iron Man** Armed with superior intellect and a nanotech battlesuit of his own design, Tony Stark stands alongside gods as the Invincible Iron Man. His state of the art armor turns any battlefield into his personal playground, allowing him to steal the spotlight he so desperately desires.

**Abilities** 

- **Normal Attack (Left Click): Repulsor Blast** – Fire nano pulse cannons forward. Spam this ability whenever you can as you put constant pressure on the enemy team. After firing the one-handed repulsor twice in a row, the next attack will fire two repulsors at once dealing higher damage.

- **Normal Attack (Right Click): Unibeam** – Fire an unibeam forward. Great ability for finishing targets off, as well as other flying characters as they are a lot harder to hit with your left click! Repulsor Blast and Unibeam share the same ammo count.

- **Invincible Pulse Cannon (Q)** – Fire a devastating pulse cannon in the targeted direction, delivering catastrophic damage to the targeted area upon impact. Great ability to use on enemies grouped together in a tight spot. Try to use your ultimate from angles that the enemy team won’t expect or keep you hidden from the enemies as it has a long cast time, making you very vulnerable since you stand in a spot as you cast it. However, doing everything properly will guarantee you a secure kill, which more often than not leads to a won fight!

- **Hyper-Velocity (LShift)** – Activate Hyper-Velocity state for swift forward flight. It can be canceled by pressing LShift again or letting go of your LShift if it is set to hold instead of press. Great tool for not only escaping from dangerous situations but also for reaching great engage positions faster! When you use it in Armor Overdrive u have and infinite energy.

- **Armor Overdrive (E)** – Activate Armor Overdrive state, enhancing damage of Repulsor Blast and Unibeam. This is Iron Man’s game changer when you are in a safe position and see enemies grouped up. Press your E and for a few seconds, you will be dealing insane damage. As soon as you start hitting enemies with your E up, you will see enemies running for their lives. Also, if you know you will have a tricky duel against somebody, press your E behind engaging them and instantly create an advantage!



- **Micro-Missile Barrage (F)** – When Hyper-Velocity or Armor Overdrive is used, Iron Man can launch a missile bombardment.

- **Gamma Overdrive (E) – Team Up Ability** – Hulk charges Doctor Strange and Iron Man with gamma radiation. When Iron Man uses Armor Overdrive, he will initiate a gamma upgrade. Iron Man paired with Hulk is a completely different beast. He is so strong that sometimes it is worth playing Hulk only because of Iron Man as pressing the E ability melts everything in front of you!
