**Black Panther** T'Challa, King of Wakanda, wields the perfect blend of the cutting-edge Vibranium technology and ancestral power drawn from the Panther God, Bast. The Black Panther bides his time until elegantly infiltrating enemy lines and commencing his hunt.Most landsharks are vicious creatures of the deep... but not Jeff! This adorable and mischievous little landshark brings splashes of joy and healing to every battle. But if the tide turns, Jeff can morph into a voracious beast, swallowing an army of foes in one giant gulp!

**Abilities** 

- **Normal Attack (Left Click): Vibranium Claws** – Slice Vibranium Claws forward. Despite doing more damage than a standard melee attack, it also has a lower range which makes it inconsistent. You should use this only in situations when you are extremely close to the target and sure you will hit it!

- **Bast’s Descent (Q)** – Summon Bast, pouncing forward, dealing damage, and attaching a Vibranium Mark to hit enemies. Great ultimate to use when you run out of Spirit Rend (LShift) as it not only deals damage and marks targets hit, it also resets your LShift. Keep in mind that the cast time isn’t too low so you have time to aim the direction of Panther!

- **Sprint Rend (LShift)** – Lunge forward and deal damage to enemies. Hitting an enemy afflicted with a Vibranium Mark produces bonus Health and refreshes the ability. Make sure not to miss your target as if you do, and you don’t have your ultimate available, you will find yourself in a tough spot!

- **Spinning Kick (E)** – Spiral forward and attach a Vibranium Mark to hit enemies. Despite leaving a mark, E has a big cast time that makes this ability worth saving for escape. Only if you are certain that you can finish off targets you can use it offensively. It also, like the ultimate ability, has a big cast time that allows you to choose your direction while using it!

- **Subtle Step (Space)** – Hold Space to run on a wall; perform a jump after detaching from the wall.

- **Spear Toss (Right Click)** – Toss a Vibranium energy spear forward, creating a Vibranium Force Field and attaching a Vibranium Mark to enemies in its radius. This is Black Panther’s best engaging tool. Try to, whenever you can, mark the target with the Spear as it not only has a large range but is also fairly easy to hit due to its low cast time helping you pull off your combo even faster!

- **Panther’s Cunning (Passive)** – Deal higher damage when at low Health. The trigger condition is when his health drops below 100 hp and he gets 20% dmg boost.

- **Djalia Disc (C) – Team Up Ability** – Magik opens a portal. Black Panther can use the portal. When you have Magik on your team, Black Panther can play much more aggressively. This ability has a very short cast time and instantly teleports you to your destination, letting you surprise enemies from angles that they couldn’t even dream of you reaching. At the same time, this ability can be used as an escape tool, leaving you with other abilities to engage enemies! Keep in mind that the cooldown is quite long so it can’t be spammed!
