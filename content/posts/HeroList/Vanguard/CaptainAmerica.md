**Captain America** Enhanced by the Super-Soldier Serum, Steven "Steve" Rogers uses his Vibranium shield and extensive combat training to confront any threat to justice. When Captain America rallies his troops, a wave of courage sweeps across the battlefield!

**Abilities** 

- **Normal Attack (Left Click): Sentinel Strike: Vibranium Claws** – Get up close to strike enemies. Landing the second hit enables a shield throw that can ricochet. It’s not that complicated you don’t need that much aim just reaction time.

- **Freedom Charge (Q)** – Grants both himself and allies along the path of continuous Bonus Health and Movement Boosts. Great ultimate for team fights u should always have the advantage when it’s up. Just don’t overthink it, if you think that it’s good to use it, it probably is.

- **Leading Dash (LShift)** – Boost speed, enabling Fearless Leap. It is very good for getting to enemies faster but also for escaping danger. After you get Fearless Leap it’s easy to use Super – Soldier Slam. Has no cooldown but you cannot shoot while running. Amazing for chasing enemies, but also running from cover to cover.

- **Super-Soldier Slam (Left Click when you are in the air or high ground)** – Slam down from the sky onto the targeted area, Knocking Enemies Airborne. The best thing for starting combos.

- **Vibranium Energy Saw (E)** – Hurl the energy-charged shield to strike enemies in a path. It ricochets so you can use it on the ground sometimes and don’t need to aim it that precisely.

- **Liberty Rush (F)** – Raise the shield and charge forward. Also, it is perfect for shortening the distance between you and the enemy and running away when u are in the danger zone. Just another great Captain’s ability for closing the distance.

- **Living Legend (Right Click)** – Raise the shield to deflect incoming projectiles, sending them ricocheting in random directions. It has 500 HP and it recovers but if it cracks it has a cooldown. Great for protecting while closing distance but also from high-damage ultimate. One thing that is bad is that you can not shoot in the direction you want, it is just random, but it would be too op due to no cooldown part.

- **Charged Aegis (C)** – When Teamed Up with Thor, Captain America electrifying enhancement. When C is activated he gets Movement Boost, and his shield becomes a ranged weapon for a couple of seconds.  It also ricochets to nearby enemies. It gives Captain some range that he desperately needs.
