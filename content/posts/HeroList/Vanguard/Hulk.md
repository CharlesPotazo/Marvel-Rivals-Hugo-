**Hulk** Brilliant scientist Dr. Bruce Banner has finally found a way to coexist with his monstrous alter ego, the Hulk. By accumulating gamma energy over multiple transformations, he can become a wise and strong Hero Hulk or a fierce and destructive Monster Hulk – a true force of fury on the battlefield!

**Abilities** 

- **Normal Attack (Left Click): Heavy Blow** – Swing fists forward to punch enemies. It’s just a normal close-range punch.

- **Indestructible Guard (LShift)** – Generate gamma shields for Hero Hulk and nearby allies, absorbing and converting damage into energy for HULK SMASH! Used mostly to help Hulk survive for longer, ideally, you want to use this ability to counter either enemy crowd control abilities or burst damage! Amazing to use at coordinated dives, for example, Venom or Spidey who are very mobile like Hulk but also amazing to jump back to your Strategist and peel for them.

- **Radioactive Lockdown (E)** – Emit gamma energy to place enemies in a quantum void that renders them immobilized and immune to all ability effects. Great for crowd controlling a big threat for your team, but also for isolating a target, in case you need to choose the lesser of two evils! Imagine jumping into the backline to attack their Strategist and there stands an annoying Punisher with his shotgun. Now you can jump in, stun Punisher, remove him from the fight for a couple of moments and now you have some free space to deny their healers space and sometimes their life. Also, you are the only one who can wake him up from stun.

- **Incredible Leap (Space)** – Hold Space to perform a charged leap that allows Hero Hulk to knock a flying enemy to the ground. Quite possibly Hulk’s strongest weapon as it allows him to quickly gap close to the target, whether it is closer or far, but also run away from dangerous situations. On top of that, it can also help Hulk reach great positions or even attach to walls from where you can prey on unsuspecting targets! Your space should always be ready.

- **Gamma Burst (Right Click)** – Emit gamma-ray bursts to inflict damage. A great ability to finish off targets with low HP, whilst also being the only long-range ability that the Hulk has!

- **Hulk Smash! (Q)** –Unleash stored gamma energy, transforming from Hero Hulk into Monster Hulk for a limited period. Can help you avoid a ton of incoming damage if timed right. Just don’t use it too early, I would recommend it as a second life when you have low hp.

- **Normal Attack (Left Click): Heavy Blow** – Swing fists forward to punch and launch frontal enemies upward. Ability that can be used to disrupt dangerous enemies, but also isolate them!

- **World Breaker (Q)** – Grab and smash the enemy in front. Yet another Hulk’s ability that can keep him alive for even longer as Hulk gains a 30% Damage Reduction while channeling it. It can also stop enemies that are popping their ultimate ability as well!

- **Radioactive Lockdown (E)** – Emit gamma energy to inflict sustained damage and place enemies in a quantum void that renders them immobilized and immune to all ability effects.
