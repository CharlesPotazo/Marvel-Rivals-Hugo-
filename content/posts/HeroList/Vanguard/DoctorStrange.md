**Doctor Strange** As the Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Stephen Strange gracefully wields ancient spells to turn the tide of even the most impossible battle. However, magic always comes at a cost, and each use of his arcane abilities gradually awakens the darkness within him.

**Abilities** 

- **Normal Attack (Left Click): Daggers of Denak** – Cast Daggers of Denak forward. It takes a little bit of practice to get use to them, but overall good damage especially for a tank character.

- **Eye of Agamotto (Q)** – Separate nearby enemies’ Souls from their bodies. Damage dealt to these Souls is transferred to their physical bodies. Great for canceling enemy ultimate abilities in certain situations. Also one of the best ult to combine with. For example, imagine just using it before Scarlets Reality Erasure (Q), while they are immobile they just explode and they can’t do anything about it. Or The Punisher’s Final Judgement (Q) on the enemies who are not moving.

The way you can surprise them is by using your teleport behind them and just drop your ult on top of their head, they will not have time to react.

- **Cloak of Levitation (LShift)** – Ascend and then enter a brief state of sustained flight. Can be used for not only avoiding damage but also for blocking flying enemy heroes and reaching the high ground! Great for escaping close-range enemies like Magik or Black Panther.

- **Maelstrom of Madness (E)** – Release Dark Magic to deal damage to nearby enemies. The perfect ability for finishing low HP enemies. Just remember if you don’t use it when it piles up you will get anti-heal if you don’t have Hulk in your team. It has a big aoe so it makes it great in crowds and against targets who are hard to hit that get near you. Also, I advise you to combo it after ult because you will charge it fast.

- **Pentagram of Farallah (F)** – Open portals between two locations, enabling all units to travel through them. An ability that allows you to re-contest points, as well as sudden attacks and denying enemies from choke points! Just try to communicate with your team before using it.

- **Shield of the Seraphim (Right Click)** – Create a protective barrier against damage. It’s a huge circle that is hard to go past through just keep in mind it will go on cooldown if you allow them to break it. No need to hold it if there’s nobody to do damage in front of you. Amazing at protecting you from huge burst of damage and one-shot ults like Iron Mans which you can block even protecting your teammates.

- **Price of Magic (Passive)** – Dark Magic accumulates with every hit on an enemy. If Dark Magic is not released, Doctor Strange will enter a state of Anti-Heal. Just use it, you will farm it fast.
