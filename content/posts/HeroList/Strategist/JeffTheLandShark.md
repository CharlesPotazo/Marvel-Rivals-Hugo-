**Jeff The Land Shark** Most landsharks are vicious creatures of the deep... but not Jeff! This adorable and mischievous little landshark brings splashes of joy and healing to every battle. But if the tide turns, Jeff can morph into a voracious beast, swallowing an army of foes in one giant gulp!

**Abilities** 

- **Normal Attack** (Left Click): Joyful Splash – Unleash a healing splash. It’s a short-range heal, amazing in rush comps where you all stick together.

- **Normal Attack** (Right Click): Aqua Burst – Launch a high-speed water sphere that bursts upon impact, dealing damage to enemies within range. You will be surprised how many kills good Jeffs get with this.

- **It’s Jeff! (Q)** – Deep dive into the scene and resurface to swallow both enemies and allies within range, activating Hide and Seek for a brief duration before ejecting the swallowed heroes forward. This ability can be used to not only completely exclude enemy characters from a team fight, but also to save your allies from certain death! Imagine going in the enemy lines pulling out their healer and spitting it in the middle of your team, or even off the map.

- **Hide and Seek (LShift)** – Dive into the scene with only his dorsal fin exposed, granting himself a Movement Boost and the wall-crawl ability. This ability can be used to run away from sketchy situations, as long as you aren’t in the middle of a team fight! But don’t get fooled into thinking you can not receive damage like this even tho it looks like it because you are going underground.

- **Healing Bubble (E)** – Spit a bubble that heals the ally who collects it and boosts all healing received by that ally. Make sure to drop a few bubbles behind your teammates that are in the frontline, as well as next to yourself as they can quickly top you and prevent you from dying! They can be destroyed if the enemy goes through them.

- **Oblivious Cuteness (Passive)** – Reduce damage taken from critical Strikes. They tried to compensate his easy-to-hit head, but I don’t think they did enough.

- **New Friends (C)** – Team Up Ability – Jeff the Land Shark and Rocket Raccoon can ride on Groot’s shoulders, receiving Damage Reduction. Very good for escaping burst damage, but don’t stay there too long because any cc ability on Groot will pull you down in the middle of the fight.

- **Frozen Spitball (X)** – Team Up Ability – Luna Snow infuses ice energy into Namor and Jeff the Land Shark, who then can tap into the ice energy to power up abilities at will.
