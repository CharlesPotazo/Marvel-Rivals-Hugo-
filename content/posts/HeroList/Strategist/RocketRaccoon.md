**Rocket Raccoon** Rocket may not look like a tech genius or an expert tactician, but anyone who's ever made his hit list has quickly regretted underestimating him. This savvy space soldier is equally eager to boost his teammates and to collect bounties on his foes.

**Abilities** 

- **Normal AttackNormal Attack 1 (Left Click): Bombard Mode** – Fire energy projectiles that deal damage. Because they are projectiles you will have to predict the movement of your enemy and that will require practice, but we have some guides for it on our site.

- **Normal Attack 2 (Right Click): Repair Mode** – Shoot bouncing spheres to heal allies. Very good when your team is close to each other. Make sure to fire spheres at such angles so they remain near your allies longer, and in close rooms, you can bounce them on the walls. Because they are really slow projectiles sometimes you want to shoot even before the fight starts.

- **C.Y.A. – Cosmic Yarn Amplifier (Q)** – Deploy a Cosmic Yarn Amplifier that grants allies a Damage Boost. This is amazing ult mid-fight and when you have a follow-up. Just keep in mind it can be destroyed so it’s not smart to put it directly in front of the enemy team.

- **Jetpack Dash (LShift)** Dash forward. Don’t be afraid to use this ability frequently as it has a really low cooldown! Racoon has a very small hitbox and with this movement, it feels like he doesn’t have it at all. Remember that you can only dash in the direction of your crosshair, not WASD. The combination of wall climb, dash, and your small hitbox makes you very annoying.

- **B.R.B. – Battle Rebirth Beacon (E)** – Deploy a Rebirth Beacon that revives a fallen ally and periodically produces armor packs and rocket jet packs. Always use this ability at the start of the game as your team can pick armor and jet packs before the game starts, while the cooldown will reset before the first battle starts! Remember that a beacon is easy to destroy, so hiding it before the fight would be very smart.

- **Wild Crawl (Passive)** – Hold Space to run on a wall. One more ability that makes Racoon unkillable. The only downside is that you can’t shoot at them while using this.

- **Flying Ace (Passive)** – Hold Space to fall slowly. Amazing at dodging slow splash projectiles, but watch out because it’s easy to track.

- **Old Friends (C) – Team Up Ability** – Rocket Raccoon can ride on Groot’s shoulders, receiving Damage Reduction. Hopping on Groot’s shoulders in sketchy situations can help you survive as you will become infinitely harder to hit! Just know that any knockdown or cc ability will throw you back on the ground and make you really vulnerable because you will be in the middle of the fight where supports never want to be.

- **Ammo Invention (Z) – Team Up Ability** – Rocket Raccoon throws an Ammo Overload Device in the target direction. Upon entering the device’s range, The Punisher and Winter Soldier receive the buffs of Infinite Ammo and Faster Firing. Try to communicate with your duelists so you use this ability when they are in a position to deal the most damage to the enemy team!
