**Luna Snow** Equal parts pop star and Super Hero, Luna Snow puts on a dazzling show with both her light and dark ice powers. The arena is her stage, where Seol Hee and her team orchestrate spectacular displays that earn her an ever-increasing number of fans and wins.

**Abilities** 

- **Normal Attack (Left Click): Light & Dark Ice** - Fire ice shots that damage enemies or heal allies. Be active all the time with it, if you don’t have to heal, shoot the enemies. This way you will charge your ult faster, and we all know how important ults are in this game.

- **Soul Resurgence (Q)** - Take center stage and toggle between two performances: Heal allies or grant them Damage Boost. An ability that can easily not only save your team from dying to the most lethal abilities but also buff your team’s damage letting them cut through the enemy team! A real game-changer, usually which Luna gets ult first will win you the fight.
Counters a lot of ult like The Punishers’ Final Judgement or Storm’s Omega Hurricane. But not smart to use against one-shot ults Like Iron Man or Magneto have.

- **Ice Arts (LShift)** – Fire ice shards for a short duration, damaging enemies or healing allies while restoring her own health. This ability will save your life so many times especially when you are getting dived because you can heal yourself while shooting, this will mean that they are gonna need a lot of time to finish you off and time is one thing dive heroes don’t have.

- **Share the Stage (E)** – Attach Idol Aura to an ally. Allies with Idol Aura also restore Health when Luna Snow is healing others. This ability makes Luna Snow a perfect healer to pair with flying heroes and heroes who spend time in the enemy’s backline because you can heal them while shooting your Vanguard and don’t waste time and resources.

- **Absolute Zero (Right Click)** –  Cast a clump of ice to freeze the hit enemy and restore health. Timing this ability properly can interrupt numerous deadly abilities, such as Scarlet Witch’s ultimate ability for instance! Don’t rush them at the beginning until you get used to it.

- **Cryo Heart (Passive)** – Automatically restores Health when casting Ice Arts or Absolute Zero. This passive makes Luna so hard to kill and that’s why she will always be reliable.

- **Smooth Skate (Passive)** – Move forward to start ice skating, giving you increased Movement Speed. Amazing for going fast from spawn to objective but also for repositioning yourself in a fight.

- **Icy Disco (Passive) – Team Up Ability** – Luna Snow infuses ice energy into Namor, who can tap into the ice energy to power up abilities at will. He gets a new turret that can protect his backline including you from flanking enemies.
