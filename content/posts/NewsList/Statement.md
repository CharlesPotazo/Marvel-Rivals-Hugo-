# Keyboard and Mouse Adapters Statement

In the wake of the buzz surrounding our recent Dev Vision, where keyboard and mouse adapters were mentioned, we've seen a surge of interest and questions from our mighty community. We're here to shed some light on this matter.
First, the Marvel Rivals team stands unwavering in our mission to foster a fair and thrilling gameplay for all. Cheating in any form is something we will battle relentlessly, and we call upon our community to rally behind our quest to maintain a positive gaming atmosphere.

# What Exactly are Keyboard and Mouse Adapters?

We define keyboard and mouse adapters as the use of software or hardware to mimic controller inputs with a keyboard and mouse. This method can grant an unfair edge in competitive play, for example, harnessing high sensitivity with the aim-assist features.
Some common adapters include the XIM series, Cronus Zen series, Titan Two series, KeyMander series, and Brook Sniper series, among others. Any device enabling keyboard and mouse emulation of controller inputs, even if not explicitly listed, will be considered a keyboard and mouse adapter.

# How We Will Address Users of Keyboard and Mouse Adapters?

We have forged a strong detection tool and couple with the keen judgment of our watchful human eyes to accurately identify those using keyboard and mouse adapters.
We believe that gaining an unjust advantage through such methods significantly impacts the gaming experience for our players. Therefore, whether on PC or console, we will take measures to vanquish this nefarious behavior. Penalties for users of keyboard and mouse adapters may include temporary or permanent account suspensions, removal from leaderboards, or other punishments depending on the circumstances.
